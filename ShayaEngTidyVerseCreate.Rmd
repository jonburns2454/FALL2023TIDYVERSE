## Assignment Prompt

Your task here is to Create an Example.  Using one or more TidyVerse packages, and any dataset from fivethirtyeight.com or Kaggle, create a programming sample “vignette” that demonstrates how to use one or more of the capabilities of the selected TidyVerse package with your selected dataset

## Tidyverse Assignment

The Tidyverse universe comes with many packages loaded with features. The stringr package is one such library. It is a package designed to help manipulate strings. It is helpful for cleaning, extracting, and manipulating text data. The dplyr library is another useful library in the Tidyverse ecosystem. The dplyr package is designed for data manipulation and is great for filtering and summarizing data. Below I will illustrate some uses of these packages.

First, load the required libraries:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(RCurl)
```

Now load the data we will be analyzing. This is data collected from many countries for the last 70+ years. It is couning the amount of people who died in every 5 year span age group in units of 1000.
```{r}
age_at_death <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shayaeng/Data607/main/TidyVerse%20Create/annual-death-rate-by-age-group.csv")
```

This dataset is extremely large. In order to filter out one section, I used str_detect() from the stringr package to look for all the data from the USA and used the filter() function from the dplyr package to filter out only that data. The columns had extremely unwieldy names, I solved that by using stringr to manipulate those character names.
```{r}
age_at_death <- age_at_death |>
  filter(str_detect(Code, "USA")) |>
  rename_all(~ str_remove(., ".*Age\\.\\.")) |>
  rename_all(~ str_replace_all(., "\\.", "-"))
  
print(colnames(age_at_death))
```

In order to do further analyses I wanted to convert the data to long format. I was able to do that using the pivot_longer() function from the tidyr package, also a part of the Tidyverse ecosystem.
```{R}
deaths_long <- age_at_death |>
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:22, names_to = "AgeGroup", values_to = "Deaths")
```

The dataset had a flaw. It didn't include a population or percentage metric to be able to analyze how the proportions might have changed over time. To solve this, I used the mutate() function from the dplyr package to add a column with the ratio of that specific age group's total deaths relative to all recorded deaths that year.
```{r}
deaths_long <- deaths_long |>
  group_by(Year) |>
  mutate(ratio_column = Deaths / sum(Deaths)) |>
  ungroup()
```

The Tidyverse also includes the ggplot2 package. Ggplot is great for creating plots and visualizations of the data. My next step was to visualize this data with a barplot, however, my data was too large to easily plot. I solved this by again filtering the data using the dplyr package. I filtered the data to only include years that end in 0 or 5. This sufficiently cuts down the size of the data being plotted while not losing out on the overall historical trends. I then used ggplot to plot the data and used a variety of different ggplot features to customize my plot.
```{r}
filtered_data <- deaths_long |>
  filter(Year %% 5 == 0) |>
  filter(AgeGroup %in% c("80-84", "85-89"))

ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = Year, y = ratio_column, fill = AgeGroup)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous() +
  labs(title = "Ratio of Deaths of People in their 80s",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Deaths Ratio") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Conclusion

JONATHAN BURNS TIDY EXTEND ASSIGNMENT:

There does seem to be an increase in life expectancy over the last 70+ years. The ratio of people dyeing in their 80s relative to dying younger than that is constantly going up over the observed data.

Almost all of what I did in this entire project used functions from packages part of the tidyverse ecosystem.

In this version of the TIDY assignment I will strive to show some more capabilites of the packages within GGPLOT. For this I will be building off Shaya's original CREATE assignment in GitHub.

Using this KAGGLE String of code that pulls data driectly from the FRED database making it so much easier to aggregate economic data into R.

#Recession


Lets say we want a unemployment growth rate function, we can use built in tidyverse functions to  do so.
In this case, imbedding a lag function within a mutate will do the trick. This is also an opportunity show the filter function.

Now we have a new variable calulating the monthly rate of change of the unemployment rate from 1990 through 10/1/2023.
```{r}
fred_raw_2 <- fred_raw %>% 
    filter(symbol == "UNRATE") %>% 
    mutate(un_rate_gr = price - lag(price))

head(fred_raw_2)
```

```{r}
summary(fred_raw_2)
```
We can also use locational numbers to rename out data so it makes sense in context with our new variable

```{r}
fred_raw_2 <- fred_raw_2 %>% 
    rename("unemp_rate" = 3) %>% 
    select(2,3,4)
```



Now that unemployment growth rate has been caclulated we can graph it. However instead of using GGPLOT I wanted to try my hand at plotly, a popular package in Python.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
```
 
```{r}
fred_raw_2 <- fred_raw_2 %>% 
    rename("fgr" = 3)


fred_un_rate <- plot_ly(fred_raw_2, x = date, y = un_rate_gr, type = "scatter", mode = "lines")
```

```{r}
fred_raw_2 %>% 
    plot_ly(x = ~date, y = ~fgr, type = "scatter", mode = "lines") %>% 
    layout(title = "Historical Growth Rates of Unemployment ", 
           xaxis = list(title = ("5 Year Span")), 
           yaxis = list(title = ("Unemployment Rate Percent Change")))
```

Plotly is great because it naturally generates interactive plot without having to program it in, plut I really like the x and y axis scaling abilities. While I know much more about GGPLOT, it seems like plotly can step in where GGPLOT has shortcomings.
