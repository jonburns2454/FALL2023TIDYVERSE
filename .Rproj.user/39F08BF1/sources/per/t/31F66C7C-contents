Vignette Title: Analyzing Spotify Track Data with Tidyverse

Vignette Purpose:
This vignette is designed to demonstrate how to use various Tidyverse functions for manipulating, visualizing, and summarizing a dataset of Spotify tracks. The primary goal is to provide clear examples of how these functions can be used to uncover insights within music data, particularly focusing on track features such as danceability, energy, and loudness, and how they vary with track popularity and genres.

Tidyverse Functions Used:
read_csv from readr to load the dataset.
filter and select from dplyr to manipulate the dataset.
mutate from dplyr to create new categorized variables.
sample_n from dplyr to work with a manageable sample size.
ggplot, geom_point, facet_wrap, labs, and theme_minimal from ggplot2 to create visualizations.
group_by and summarize from dplyr to summarize the data.
ggsave to save the created plots.

Instructions to Run the Vignette:
Ensure that you have R and the Tidyverse package installed.
Download the R Markdown file from the provided link.
Open the R Markdown file in an R environment (such as RStudio).
Install any missing packages using install.packages("package_name").
Run the R Markdown file to execute the code chunks. The vignette is self-contained and includes comments explaining each step.
Optionally, modify the read_csv path to point to your local dataset if not using the provided online source.

By following through this vignette, users will be able to understand how to employ Tidyverse functions effectively to analyze a music dataset, which can be further generalized to other types of data analysis workflows.
